//  Errors may be detected and reported in the scanner, the parser,

//  output. This simple class just centralizes the printing of error messages, 
//  so that (for example) we can centralize the decision about where the 
//  messages should go.  An ErrorReport object should be created by the driver
//  and passed to each stage that needs a place to send error messages.
